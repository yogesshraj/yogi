*****WEEKLY GBU*****

***GOOD***
	On Tuesday we celebrated Ganapathy Visarjan. We went to Chamunda Temple for worship. In my area the temple will look 
	different . But here it looked different. I felt like a new experiance. We went in a truck to the temple. While going
	I felt like home because in our area also in Ganapathy Visarjan we used go like this, On ganesh chadurthi i felt so 
	bad as I thought I couldn't celebrate here but it was totally changed. I felt like I was in my area . The only 
	difficulty is we used to celebrate in sea but here we celebrated in river . But that was not a problem. I felt like 
	I was in Kanyakumari. At afternoon the lunch was saambar, I liked it very much. It was like eating in my home. I am 
	feeling like I am learning new cultures and styles of different state friends, usually I like that very much . Nowadays 
	all of them are speaking to me well as it was to bad before. I think all of them changed after the submission of laptop.
	Now I am feeling like I am totally fitted in this new culture. I like it very much. Now the food is also good to eat .
	For one week water in the river was very good . I am slowly learning swimming . I started doing some exercises. Today 
	the pair was changed. My new partner is Dipesh. The new rules and regulations has been implimented . We went to the 
	garden and cleaned the garden as there was no Internet to study. After cleaning the garden looked very nice .

***BAD***
	All of the friends are playing cricket but I don't like that game, because that game makes me feel lazy. If you take volleyball,kabbadi,football,etc... means
	we will run here and there but in cricket it is not like that most of th time we will stand simply anyways no problem 
	new volleyball arrived today. I will play volleyball. Nitesh bro,Bavnesh bro and Roshan went to see the cricket match
	to stadium. But unfortunately the match was abondened due to rain for past one week it didn't rained but yesterday it
	heavily. We also sad because we fooled our friends and family that we are going to match but as the match was abondened 
	they teased us well. Till now they don't know the reality. I'm sleeping late night I don't want to sleep late night .
	so I'm going to sleep early. Internet was not working for two days .

***UGLY***
	Nothing ugly in this week as this week went very nice.

***NEXT***
	Soon I'll complete files in python and will start revising from beggning as I'm feeling like I forget most of the things.
